# I03_mistplay

This is the repo for the the Mistplay Data Science Challenge!

For this challenge, I have created 2 notebooks containing the relevant code to solve it. The first notebook works as a preprocessing notebook, in which I revised the data and perfomed the necessary feature engineering/cleaning. The second notebook contains the training and evaluation portion of the challenge.
